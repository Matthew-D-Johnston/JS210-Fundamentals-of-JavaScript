### 1. Defaults

The `processOrder` function shown below accepts the following arguments: `price`, `quantity`, `discount`, `serviceCharge` and `tax`. Any arguments other than `price` may be omitted when calling the function, in which case, default values will be assigned.

```javascript
function processOrder(price, quantity, discount, serviceCharge, tax) {
  if (!quantity) {
    quantity = 1;
  }
  
  if (!discount) {
    discount = 0;
  }
  
  if (!serviceCharge) {
    serviceCharge = 0.1;
  }
  
  if (!tax) {
    tax = 0.15;
  }
  
  return (price * quantity) * (1 - discount) * (1 + serviceCharge) * (1 + tax);
}

processOrder(100);			// 126.5
```

This function uses conditional statements to test whether arguments have been omitted. When an argument is omitted, JavaScript automatically initializes it to a value of `undefined`. The function takes advantage of this behavior by setting `undefined` arguments to a default value.  

The following variation of the `processOrder` function has the same behavior as the first:

```javascript
function processOrder(price, quantity, discount, serviceCharge, tax) {
  quantity = quantity || 1;
  discount = discount || 0;
  serviceCharge = serviceCharge || 0.1;
  tax = tax || 0.15;
  
  return (price * quantity) * (1 = discount) * (1 + serviceCharge) * (1 + tax);
}
```

However, both of these solutions have a limitation that can lead to an incorrect result for certain inputs. What is this limitation and how does it affect the result?

###### My Solution

One limitation that affects both of these solutions is if a value of `0` is passed in as an argument. Since `0` is falsy in JavaScript it will cause the conditional statements to assign the default values to the arguments rather than `0`. This is likely not what we want.  

###### LS Solution

The limitation of these solutions is that when one of the optional arguments has a value of `0`, the function incorrectly treats that argument as if it has been omitted. For example:  

```javascript
processOrder(100, 2, 0.1, 0, 0);      // 227.7 -- incorrect result!
```

This happens because `0` is a **falsy** value in JavaScript, so any arguments with a value of `0` get reassigned a default value. One way to prevent this from happening is to explicitly test whether the input arguments have a value of `undefined`, instead of relying on them being falsy â€” e.g., `(quantity === undefined)`. (Note that when the value passed for `discount` is `0`, the function works as expected because the default value of `discount` is also `0`.)

### 2. Equal

Read through the following code. Currently, it does not log the expected result. Explain why this happens, then refactor the code so that it works as expected.  

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Victor' };
const otherPerson = { name: 'Victor' };

console.log(person === otherPerson);		// false -- expected: true
```

###### My Solution

Even though both variables (i.e. `person` and `otherPerson`) are assigned to objects with the exact same property (i.e. name and value pair), they are still referencing separate objects in memory. The equality operator `===` is evaluating whether or not the operands are the same object, not whether they contain the same values. Thus, the result is `false`.  

In order to compare the objects based on the equality of the values of their respective properties, we must do something like this:

```javascript
console.log(person.name === otherPerson.name);		// true
```

Above, we use the same key for each object to access the value associated with that key. The boolean value of `true` should be logged to the console if the values are identical.  

###### LS Solution

This code can be fixed by making sure that the two variables reference the same object instead of two different objects with the same properties.  

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Victor' };
const otherPerson = person;

console.log(person === otherPerson); 			// true
```

In JavaScript, every object literal creates a new object. When this object is assigned to a variable, a **reference** to the object is stored in that variable. In the example above, the only way to ensure that the two variables compare equally is to have them reference the same object.

### 3. Amount Payable

What does the following code log? Why is this so?

```javascript
let startingBalance = 1;
const chicken = 5;
const chickenQuantity = 7;

function totalPayable(item, quantity) {
  return startingBalance + (item * quantity);
}

startingBalance = 5;
console.log(totalPayable(chicken, chickenQuantity));

startingBalance = 10;
console.log(totalPayable(chicken, chickenQuantity));
```

###### My Solution

This program logs:

```
40
45
```

The first logged value, `40`, is a result of logging the return value of the `totalPayable()` function when passed the variables `chicken` and `chickenQuantity` as arguments. However, the second logged value, `45`, results from the exact same operation: logging the return value of the `totalPayable()` function with `chicken` and `chickenQuantity` as arguments. The difference in the values comes from the fact that we have reassigned the `startingBalance` variable, which is called within the function, and thus resulting in different ultimate return values of the function despite passing the same values as arguments.

###### LS Solution

This code logs `40` and `45`.  

###### Discussion

You may want to review the concept of [closures](https://launchschool.com/lessons/511a561c/assignments/a480ef58). Closures have functions *"retain access"* to variables defined in an *"enclosing scope"*. In the code above, the *enclosing scope* is the global (window) scope containing the variables `startingBalance`, `chicken`, and `chickenQuantity`. *Retaining access* means that a variable's value is not fixed at the time when the function is defined or first executed. Instead, the variable's value is dynamically looked up each time the function is called. Therefore, the value of `startingBalance` on line 6 is not `1`; instead, the value is a reference to the value stored in the `startingBalance` variable in the global scope.  

As a result of how closures work, the first time the `totalPayable` function is called, the value of `startingBalance` is `5`; the second time the function is called, the value of `startingBalance` is `10`.

### 4. Caller

The `doubler` function in the code below takes two arguments: a `number` to double and return, and a string containing the name of the function's `caller`.

```javascript
function doubler(number, caller) {
  console.log(`This function was called by ${caller}.`);
  return number + number;
}

doubler(5, 'Victor');										// returns 10
// logs:
// This function was called by Victor.
```

Write a `makeDoubler` function that takes a `caller` name as an argument, and returns a function that has the same behavior as `doubler`, but with a preset `caller`.  

Example:

```javascript
const doubler = makeDoubler('Victor');
doubler(5);															// returns 10
// logs:
// This function was called by Victor.
```

###### My Solution

```javascript
function makeDoubler(caller) {
  const doubling = function(number) {
    console.log(`This function was called by ${caller}.`);
    return number + number;
  };

  return doubling;
}
```

###### LS Solution

This solution leverages that functions in JavaScript are first-class. It satisfies the requirement that `makeDoubler` must take a `caller` name and it returns a variation of the `doubler` function.  

```javascript
function makeDoubler(caller) {
  return number => {
    console.log(`This function was called by ${caller}.`);
    return number + number;
  };
}

const doubler = makeDoubler('Victor');
doubler(5);																// returns 10
// logs:
// This function was called by Victor.
```

Notice that the returned anonymous function expression assigned to the `doubler` variable still retains access to the `caller` variable in its closure, even after the `makeDoubler` function returns.
